        <p>Learning to solve a Rubik's Cube at the age of 10, I discovered my passion for problem-solving. As I continued to pursue my interest in puzzles, I realized the similarities between puzzles and programming, which led me to explore the field of software engineering.</p><p> Currently seeking opportunities to apply my skills in a professional setting, I am looking for a software engineering internship.
