    <div class="bodyer">
      I have always been interested in computers, and with it being my favourite subject in highschool, choosing it to be my degree in university was a no-brainer. 
      <br/><br/>
      Before I went to university, I had experience as a system engineer, where I spearheaded the automation and parallelization of our tasks, which included the migration of local to AD accounts and modification of the registry. Despite it being a relatively short working experience, I still learned a lot in terms of leadership as I took the position of a mentor for new employees. 
      <br/><br/>
      I am now a committee member of our Computer Science Club at The University of Adelaide, where we often host events such as workshops and CTFs for our fellow students. Besides hosting them, I also participate in other international CTFs with our University team AdelaideB9. 
      <br/><br/>
      I was very fortunate to meet a bunch of great people in the various student clubs of my university, including Ravi Hammond, Jason Beh, and Nathan Shepherd. With their mentorship, my algorithm designing and C++ skills are now better than ever, and I am confident that I am capable of taking up the job of a software engineer. 
      <br/><br/>
      I am currently looking for a penultimate year internship, and I would love to have a referral. Please check out my resume:
