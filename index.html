        About
      </h1>
        I have always been interested in computers, and with it being my favourite subject in highschool, choosing it to
        be my degree in university was a no-brainer.
        <br /><br />
        Before I went to university, I had experience as a system engineer, where I spearheaded the automation and
        parallelization of our tasks, which included the migration of local to AD accounts and modification of the
        registry. Despite it being a relatively short working experience, I still learned a lot in terms of leadership
        as I took the position of a mentor for new employees.
        <br /><br />
        I am now a committee member of our Computer Science Club at The University of Adelaide, where we often host
        events such as workshops and CTFs for our fellow students. Besides hosting them, I also participate in other
        international CTFs with our University team AdelaideB9.
        <br /><br />
        I was very fortunate to meet a bunch of great people in the various student clubs of my university, including
        Ravi Hammond, Jason Beh, and Nathan Shepherd. With their mentorship, my algorithm designing and C++ skills are
        now better than ever, and I am confident that I am capable of taking up the job of a software engineer.
        <br /><br />
        I am currently looking for a penultimate year internship, and I would love to have a referral. Please check out
        my resume: <a href="https://github.com/tinnamchoi/resumes/blob/master/resume.pdf">~/resume.pdf</a>
