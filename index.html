        I have always been interested in computers, and with it being my favourite subject in highschool, choosing it to
        be my degree in university was a no-brainer.
        <br /><br />
        Before I went to university, I had experience as a system engineer, where I spearheaded the automation and
        parallelization of our tasks, which included the migration of local to AD accounts and modification of the
        registry. Despite it being a relatively short working experience, I still learned a lot in terms of leadership
        as I took the position of a mentor for new employees.
        <br /><br />
        I am now a committee member of our Computer Science Club at The University of Adelaide, where we often host
        events such as workshops and CTFs for our fellow students. Besides hosting them, I also participate in other
        international CTFs with our University team AdelaideB9.
        <br /><br />
        I was very fortunate to meet a bunch of great people in the various student clubs of my university, including
        Ravi Hammond, Jason Beh, and Nathan Shepherd. With their mentorship, my algorithm designing and C++ skills are
        now better than ever, and I am confident that I am capable of taking up the job of a software engineer.
        <br /><br />
        I am currently looking for a penultimate year internship, and I would love to have a referral. Please check out
        my resume:

          (UNIHACK 2023)</span><br>
        This is my first hackathon, and also my first time using APIs. Our team was a bit disorganized at first as we
        had no prior experience with hackathons, but we managed make a web app to analyze a person's Spotify listening
        history and estimate their Myers-Briggs personality type using data from <a
          href="https://www.16personalities.com/articles/music-preferences-by-personality-type">16personalities</a> and
        Spotify.

        <span class="project_title"><a href="https://tinnamchoi.github.io/negative-base-converter/">Negative Base
            Converter</a> (ALPHA)</span><br>
        This is a web app that converts numbers from any base to any other base, including negative bases, which have
        the unique property of being able to represent all positive and negative integers without using a negative sign.
        As this topic is not very popular, I had to do a lot of research in order to discover an algorithm that can deal
        with the conversion properly especially when it comes to fractional numbers.
        <br><br>
        <span class="project_title"><a href="https://allrgb.com/">allRGB</a></span><br>
        This is part of a bigger project started by "deidee", which has the objective to create images with one pixel
        for every RGB color, without any duplicate or missing colors. I aimed to create a Python program that would take
        any image and convert it into an allRGB image. As this was my first programming project ever, my program used
        the brute-force solution, and although functional, it was quite inefficient. Now that I am more familiar with
        algorithm design and data structures, I plan to rewrite the program to make it more efficient.
